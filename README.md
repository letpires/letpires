### Hey there üëã,


I graduated in Civil Engineering from the Regional University of Blumenau in 2019 and am currently migrating to Data Science. In November 2020, I started my Data Science studies at Alura's Bootcamp, in which I had the opportunity to develop in the area through the creation of DS and ML projects. In fact, the last project I developed (Predicting the need for ICU beds at Hospital S√≠rio Liban√™s), was the one that opened doors to enter the data market. Today I work as a Data Scientist Jr. at Sauter, a partner company Google.


</ul>
I am passionate about technology, entrepreneurship and personal development. Thus, I am always looking for new ways of improvement, through books, media and others. I also created an Instagram to be able to share content, knowledge and learning about this world of technology, Data Science, productivity.
