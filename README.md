### Hey there ðŸ‘‹,


I graduated in Civil Engineering from the Regional University of Blumenau in 2019 and am currently migrating to Data Science. For this reason, I recently started studies at the Applied Data Science Bootcamp at Alura and I have been developing projects in the area.

I am passionate about technology, entrepreneurship and personal development. Thus, I am always looking for new ways of improvement, through books, media and others. I also created an Instagram to be able to share content, knowledge and learning about this world of technology, Data Science, productivity.
